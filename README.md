# SmartMailbox
Project One MCT Howest Kortrijk
This is a little project I made for school. It's a mailbox that detects mail and measures the temperature and rain.
Everything is saved in a SQL database and can be seen on the local Apache webserver. The door can be controlled from the webserver or via the 4x4 keypad.
